##  **DESKTOP APP**

This desktop application depends on software that is installed on a computer that meets the technical installation requirements.

Its main advantage, apart from the speed to execute the processes, since its controls and events occur on the same equipment, is offering the ability to use it without an Internet connection, being functional at any time, providing a benefit over web applications.

The downside is that most desktop applications have, the maintenance of updates, since you will have to go through each of the workstations to execute the update.

This project is developed with **Python Technology**, the **Tkinter Library, Pandas** and **MySQL** for the Database.

Finally, it never hurts to **remember** to **back up the database** from time to time. This application can **export** an **Excel CSV** file with all the records from the database.
